    <h1>Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops</h1>
    <p>Sometimes when working with arrays, it is very handy to be able to iterate through each item to find one or more
        elements that we might need, or to manipulate an array based on which data items meet a certain set of criteria.
        JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in slightly different ways to achieve
        different results (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.), however the technique which is most flexible and
        offers us the greatest amount of control is a simple for loop.</p>

        function greaterThanTen(arr) {
            let newArr1 = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                if (arr[i] > 10) {
                    newArr1.push(arr[i]);
                }
            }
            console.log(newArr1)
            return newArr1;
        }

        greaterThanTen([2, 12, 8, 14, 80, 0, 1]);

        const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

        function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
            let newArr = [];

            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) == -1) {
                    newArr.push(arr[i]);
                }
            }
            console.log(newArr)
            // Only change code above this line
            return newArr;
        }

        console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));
