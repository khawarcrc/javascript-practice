    <h1>Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects</h1>
    <p>At their most basic, objects are just collections of key-value pairs. In other words, they are pieces of data
        (values) mapped to unique identifiers called properties (keys). <br>
        Bracket notation is required if your property has a space in it or if you want to use a variable to name the
        property. In the above case, the property is enclosed in quotes to denote it as a string and will be added
        exactly as shown. Without quotes, it will be evaluated as a variable and the name of the property will be
        whatever value the variable is.
    </p>
