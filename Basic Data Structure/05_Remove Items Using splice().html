    <h1>Remove Items Using splice()</h1>
    <h2>Defination</h2>
    <p>
        If we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well,
        that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements
        from anywhere in an array.
    </p>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of
        splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called
        upon. We Know that arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0.
        splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the
        second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value
        of the removed elements:
    </p>

    <script>
        let array0 = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

        array0.splice(3, 2);
        console.log(array0)

        let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];

        let newArray1 = array.splice(3, 2);
        console.log(newArray1)

        const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
        // Only change code below this line
        let newArray2 = arr.splice(1, 4)

        // Only change code above this line
        console.log(arr);
    </script>
</body>
