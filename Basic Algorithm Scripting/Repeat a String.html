    <ul>
        <li>i is initially set to 0 (let i = 0).</li>
        <li>The loop checks if i (0) is less than num (3). Since this condition is true, the loop begins.</li>
        <li>In the loop body, accumulatedStr is concatenated with "abc". So, accumulatedStr becomes "abc".</li>
        <li>i is incremented by 1 (i++), so now i is 1.</li>
        <li>The loop checks the condition again. Since i (1) is still less than num (3), the loop continues.</li>
        <li>"abc" is concatenated with accumulatedStr again, so accumulatedStr becomes "abcabc".</li>
        <li>i is incremented again, and now it's 2.</li>
        <li>The loop checks the condition, and it's still true, so it continues.</li>
        <li>"abc" is concatenated with accumulatedStr once more, making accumulatedStr "abcabcabc".</li>
        <li>i is incremented to 3.</li>
        <li>The loop condition is checked again. This time, i (3) is not less than num (3), so the loop exits.</li>
        <li>Finally, accumulatedStr contains the repeated string "abcabcabc", and this value is returned from the
            function.</li>
