    <h1>delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties</h1>
    <p> If we wanted to remove the apples key, we can remove it by using the delete keyword like this:
        <br>

        delete foods.apples;
    </p>
    <script>
        let foods = {
            apples: 25,
            oranges: 32,
            plums: 28,
            bananas: 13,
            grapes: 35,
            strawberries: 27
        };

        // Only change code below this line
        delete foods.oranges
        delete foods.plums
        delete foods.strawberries,

            // Only change code above this line

            console.log(foods);
    </script>
