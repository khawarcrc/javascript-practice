// The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure.
//  This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one level, 
//  or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it.
//  Notice it contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data types:
//  a multi-dimensional array

let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray);
let yourArray = ['one', 3 , true , undefined , null, 10];
console.log(yourArray.length)
