        // The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be able
        //         to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, let's begin to think about
        //         how we can access that array's information.
        // In an array, each array item has an index. This index doubles as the position of that item in the array, and how
        //         you reference it. However, it is important to note, that JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the
        //         first element of an array is actually at the zeroth position, not the first. In order to retrieve an element
        //         from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly, to a
        //         variable which references an array object. This is known as bracket notation.

        let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
        // Only change code below this line
        myArray[1] = "not b anymore";
        myArray[0] = ['1', 2, null, undefined];
        myArray[2] = 3;
        // Only change code above this line
        console.log(myArray);
    </script>
