    <h1>complex multi-dimensional arrays</h1>
    <p>One of the most powerful features when thinking of arrays as data structures, is that arrays can contain, or even
        be completely made up of other arrays. We have seen arrays that contain arrays in previous challenges, but
        fairly simple ones. However, arrays can contain an infinite depth of arrays that can contain other arrays, each
        with their own arbitrary levels of depth, and so on. In this way, an array can very quickly become a very
        complex data structure, known as a multi-dimensional, or nested array.
    </p>
    <p>The deep array is nested 2 levels deep. The deeper arrays are 3 levels deep. The deepest arrays are 4 levels, and
        the deepest-est? is 5.</p>

        //  so that it has exactly five levels of depth (remember, the outer-most array is level 1).

        //   and on the fifth level, include the string deepest.
